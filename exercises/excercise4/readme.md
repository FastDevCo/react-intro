# Excercise 4

Playing with "real" data.

This is very short excercise. You just need slightly change your components.


## Tasks
- Copy mock-data from `excercise4/todos.json` and add it to your `index.js`. Substitute `originalTasks` with that.
- Modify your program to render each todo-item's **task**-property into the `<li>`-element.
