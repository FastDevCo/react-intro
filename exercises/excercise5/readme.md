More style to your tasks

Were now having the basic structure of your application but we need to refine it little more and add some classes.

Our UI-designer has already made some stylesheet to use with your application. You can enable it by uncommenting from `index.html`.

After refining components structures your application should look like `rendered_example.html` when rendered.

## Tasks
- Assign correct style classes (follow the `rendered_example.html`) to elements in components
- Create or replace elements from components so they render out as example html-file


## Tips

In React you must use `className` instead of `class`-attribute for defining classes to elements.

**ie.**

```
<div className="task"></div>


//

<div class="task"></div>
```
